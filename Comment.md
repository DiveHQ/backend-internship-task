With this assignment i employed Django a python web_Framework with support packages :
django rest_Framework
and Knox 

I also used the Token based authenticatication system which i prefere compare to the section based Authentication

when testing using postman, it is posible to set the Token generated by login in as a globl variable to 
ease the stress of copy and paste for all routes/endpoints
